abstract="In recent years, topics such as fraud detection and fraud prevention have received a lot of attention on the research front, in particular from payment card issuers. The reason for this increase in research activity can be attributed to the huge annual financial losses incurred by card issuers due to fraudulent use of their card products. A successful strategy for dealing with fraud can quite literally mean millions of dollars in savings per year on operational costs. Artificial neural networks have come to the front as an at least partially successful method for fraud detection. The success of neural networks in this field is, however, limited by their underlying design - a feedforward neural network is simply a static mapping of input vectors to output vectors, and as such is incapable of adapting to changing shopping profiles of legitimate card holders. Thus, fraud detection systems in use today are plagued by misclassifications and their usefulness is hampered by high false positive rates. We address this problem by proposing the use of a dynamic machine learning method in an attempt to model the time series inherent in sequences of same card transactions. We believe that, instead of looking at individual transactions, it makes more sense to look at sequences of transactions as a whole; a technique that can model time in this context will be more robust to minor shifts in legitimate shopping behaviour. In order to form a clear basis for comparison, we did some investigative research on feature selection, preprocessing, and on the selection of performance measures; the latter will facilitate comparison of results obtained by applying machine learning methods to the biased data sets largely associated with fraud detection. We ran experiments on real world credit card transactional data using two innovative machine learning techniques: the support vector machine (SVM) and the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM).",

abstract = {In this big data era, banks (like any other large company) are looking for novel ways to leverage their existing data assets. A major data source that has not been used to the full extent yet, is the massive fine-grained payment data on their customers. In this paper, a design is proposed that builds predictive credit scoring models using the fine-grained payment data. Using a real-life data set of 183 million transactions made by 2.6 million customers, we show that our proposed design adds complementary predictive power to the current credit scoring models. Such improvement has a big impact on the overall working of the bank, from applicant scoring to minimum capital requirements.},

abstract = "The credit card industry has been growing rapidly recently, and thus huge numbers of consumers’ credit data are collected by the credit department of the bank. The credit scoring manager often evaluates the consumer’s credit with intuitive experience. However, with the support of the credit classification model, the manager can accurately evaluate the applicant’s credit score. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification is currently an active research area and successfully solves classification problems in many domains. This study used three strategies to construct the hybrid SVM-based credit scoring models to evaluate the applicant’s credit score from the applicant’s input features. Two credit datasets in UCI database are selected as the experimental data to demonstrate the accuracy of the SVM classifier. Compared with neural networks, genetic programming, and decision tree classifiers, the SVM classifier achieved an identical classificatory accuracy with relatively few input features. Additionally, combining genetic algorithms with SVM classifier, the proposed hybrid GA-SVM strategy can simultaneously perform feature selection task and model parameters optimization. Experimental results show that SVM is a promising addition to the existing data mining methods."
